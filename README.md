## Advent of Code 2024 Solutions
These are my solutions to all problems in the 2024 edition of advent of code. Some days were particularly good, and got my remembering parts of my degree long gone. 

All code is written in Python by me, with some days containing notes if I felt like doing a write up of my solution. Most days run independently in less than < 1s. Some days don't, maybe I'll come back and re-factor the logic or write it in a slightly more performant language.
